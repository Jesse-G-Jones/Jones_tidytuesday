latlong <- data.frame(lon= 38, lat=40) #create an object to specify the lat and long in my ggmap

  distinct() %>% #select unique rows (no repeat data); I don't think I needed this, but I kept it as a precaution
  mutate(total_time=age_start-age_end) %>% #create a new column for calculating the total number of years this crop was cultivated
  filter(genus=="Aegilops") #Only look for crops in the genus Aegilops

ggmap(location)+ #plot a map
  geom_point(data=crop_tidy, aes(x=latitude, y=longitude, color=total_time), #plot points on my graph from the crop_tidy data based on lat & long, with color representing the number of years cultivated
